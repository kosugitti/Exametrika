\title{Item-Total Correlation}
\usage{
ItemTotalCorr(U, na = NULL, Z = NULL, w = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{U is a data matrix of the type matrix or data.frame.}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of item-total correlations. Values typically range
from -1 to 1, where:
\itemize{
\item Values near 1: Strong positive discrimination
\item Values near 0: No discrimination
\item Negative values: Potential item problems (lower ability students
performing better than higher ability students)
}
}
\description{
Item-Total correlation (ITC) is a Pearson's correlation of an item with
the Number-Right Score (NRS) or total score. This function is applicable
only to binary response data.

The ITC is a measure of item discrimination, indicating how well an item
distinguishes between high and low performing examinees.
}
\details{
The correlation is calculated between:
\itemize{
\item Each item's responses (0 or 1)
\item The total test score (sum of correct responses)
}
Higher positive correlations indicate items that better discriminate between
high and low ability examinees.
}
\note{
Values below 0.2 might indicate problematic items that should be reviewed.
Values above 0.3 are generally considered acceptable.
