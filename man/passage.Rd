\title{Passage Rate of Student}
\usage{
passage(U, na = NULL, Z = NULL, w = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{U is a data matrix of the type matrix or data.frame.}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the passage rate for each student.
Values range from 0 to 1 (or maximum weight) where:
\itemize{
\item 1: Perfect score on all attempted items
\item 0: No correct answers
\item NA: No items attempted
}
}
\description{
The Passage Rate for each student is calculated as their Number-Right Score (NRS)
divided by the number of items presented to them. This function is applicable
only to binary response data.

The passage rate is calculated as:
\deqn{P_i = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J z_{ij}u_{ij}w_j}{\sum_{j=1}^J z_{ij}}}
where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{z_{ij}} is the missing response indicator (0/1)
\item \eqn{u_{ij}} is the response (0/1)
\item \eqn{w_j} is the item weight
}
}
\note{
The passage rate accounts for missing responses by only considering items that
were actually presented to each student. This provides a fair comparison
between students who attempted different numbers of items.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simple binary data
U <- matrix(c(1,0,1,1,0,1), ncol=2)
passage(U)

# With missing responses
U[1,1] <- NA
passage(U, na=NA)
}
}
