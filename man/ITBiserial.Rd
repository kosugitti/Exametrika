\title{Item-Total Biserial Correlation}
\usage{
ITBiserial(U, na = NULL, Z = NULL, w = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{U is a data matrix of the type matrix or data.frame.}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of item-total biserial correlations. Values range
from -1 to 1, where:
\itemize{
\item Values near 1: Strong positive discrimination
\item Values near 0: No discrimination
\item Negative values: Potential item problems
}
}
\description{
The Item-Total Biserial Correlation computes the biserial correlation
between each item and the total score. This function is applicable only
to binary response data.

This correlation provides a measure of item discrimination, indicating how well
each item distinguishes between high and low performing examinees.
}
\note{
The biserial correlation is generally preferred over the point-biserial
correlation when the dichotomization is artificial (i.e., when the underlying
trait is continuous).
