\arguments{
\item{U}{U is either a data class of Exametrika, or raw data. When raw data is given,
it is converted to the Exametrika class with the \link{dataFormat} function.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{seed}{seed for random.}

\item{population}{Population size. The default is 20}

\item{Rs}{Survival Rate. The default is 0.5}

\item{Rm}{Mutation Rate. The default is 0.005}

\item{maxParents}{Maximum number of edges emanating from a single node. The default is 2.}

\item{maxGeneration}{Maximum number of generations.}

\item{successiveLimit}{Termination conditions. If the optimal individual does not change
for this number of generations, it is considered to have converged.}

\item{crossover}{Configure crossover using numerical values. Specify 0 for uniform
crossover, where bits are randomly copied from both parents. Choose 1 for single-point
crossover with one crossover point, and 2 for two-point crossover with two crossover points.
The default is 0.}

\item{elitism}{Number of elites that remain without crossover when transitioning to
the next generation.}

\item{filename}{Specify the filename when saving the generated adjacency matrix in CSV format.
The default is null, and no output is written to the file.}

\item{verbose}{verbose output Flag. default is TRUE}
}
\value{

\item{adj}{Optimal adjacency matrix}
\item{testlength}{Length of the test. The number of items included in the test.}
\item{TestFitIndices}{Overall fit index for the test.See also \link{TestFit}}
\item{nobs}{Sample size. The number of rows in the dataset.}
\item{testlength}{Length of the test. The number of items included in the test.}
\item{crr}{correct response ratio}

\description{
Genearging a DAG from data using a genetic algorithm.
}
\details{
This function generates a DAG from data using a genetic algorithm.
Depending on the size of the data and the settings, the computation may
take a significant amount of computational time. For details on the
settings or algorithm, see Shojima(2022), section 8.5
