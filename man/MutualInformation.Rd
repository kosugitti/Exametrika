\usage{
MutualInformation(U, na = NULL, Z = NULL, w = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{U is a data matrix of the type matrix or data.frame.}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}
}
\value{
A matrix of mutual information values with Exametrika class.
Each element (i,j) represents the mutual information between items i and j,
measured in bits. Higher values indicate stronger interdependence between items.
}
\description{
Mutual Information is a measure that represents the degree of interdependence
between two items. This function is applicable only to binary response data.
The measure is calculated using the joint probability distribution of responses
between item pairs and their marginal probabilities.
