\title{Student Percentile Ranks}
\usage{
percentile(U, na = NULL, Z = NULL, w = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{U is a data matrix of the type matrix or data.frame.}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of percentile ranks (1-100) for each student, where:
\itemize{
\item 100: Highest performing student(s)
\item 50: Median performance
\item 1: Lowest performing student(s)
}
}
\description{
The percentile function calculates each student's relative standing in the group,
expressed as a percentile rank (1-100). This function is applicable only to
binary response data.

The percentile rank indicates the percentage of scores in the distribution
that fall below a given score. For example, a percentile rank of 75 means
the student performed better than 75\% of the group.
}
\note{
Percentile ranks are calculated using the empirical cumulative distribution
function of standardized scores. Tied scores receive the same percentile rank.
The values are rounded up to the nearest integer to provide ranks from 1 to 100.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simple binary data
U <- matrix(c(1,0,1,1,0,1), ncol=2)
percentile(U)

# With missing values
U[1,1] <- NA
percentile(U, na=NA)
}
}
