\title{Stanine Scores}
\usage{
stanine(U, na = NULL, Z = NULL, w = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{U is a data matrix of the type matrix or data.frame.}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\describe{
\item{stanine}{The score boundaries for each stanine level}
\item{stanineScore}{The stanine score (1-9) for each student}
}
}
\description{
The Stanine (Standard Nine) scoring system divides students into nine groups
based on a normalized distribution. This function is applicable only to
binary response data.

These groups correspond to the following percentile ranges:
\itemize{
\item Stanine 1: lowest 4\% (percentiles 1-4)
\item Stanine 2: next 7\% (percentiles 5-11)
\item Stanine 3: next 12\% (percentiles 12-23)
\item Stanine 4: next 17\% (percentiles 24-40)
\item Stanine 5: middle 20\% (percentiles 41-60)
\item Stanine 6: next 17\% (percentiles 61-77)
\item Stanine 7: next 12\% (percentiles 78-89)
\item Stanine 8: next 7\% (percentiles 90-96)
\item Stanine 9: highest 4\% (percentiles 97-100)
}
}
\note{
Stanine scores provide a normalized scale with:
\itemize{
\item Mean = 5
\item Standard deviation = 2
\item Scores range from 1 to 9
\item Score of 5 represents average performance
}
}

\dontrun{
# Calculate stanine scores
result <- stanine(U)

# View score boundaries

# View individual scores
