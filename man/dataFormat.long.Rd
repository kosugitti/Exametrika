dataFormat.long(
  data,
  na = NULL,
  Sid = NULL,
  Qid = NULL,
  Resp = NULL,
  w = NULL,
  response.type = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{is a data matrix of the type matrix or data.frame. This must
contain at least three columns to identify the student, the item, and
the response. Additionally, it can include a column for the weight of
the items.}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Sid}{Specify the column number containing the student ID label vector.}

\item{Qid}{Specify the column number containing the Question label vector.}

\item{Resp}{Specify the column number containing the Response value vector.}

\item{w}{Specify the column number containing the weight vector.}

\item{response.type}{type of response data: "binary" or "polytomous" (can be abbreviated as "poly").
If NULL, the type is automatically determined from the data.}
}
\value{
\describe{
\item{U}{For binary response data. A matrix with rows representing the sample size and columns
representing the number of items, where elements are either 0 or 1. \eqn{u_{ij}=1} indicates
that student i correctly answered item j, while \eqn{u_{ij}=0} means that student i answered
item j incorrectly.}
\item{Q}{For polytomous response data. A matrix with rows representing the sample size and columns
representing the number of items, where elements are non-negative integers. When input data is
in factor format, the factor levels are converted to consecutive integers starting from 1, and
the original factor labels are stored in factor_labels.}
\item{ID}{The ID label given by the designated column or function.}
\item{ItemLabel}{The item names given by the provided column names or function.}
\item{Z}{Missing indicator matrix. \eqn{z_{ij}=1} indicates that item j is presented to Student i,
while \eqn{z_{ij}=0} indicates item j is NOT presented to Student i.}
\item{w}{Item weight vector}
\item{response.type}{Character string indicating the type of response data:
"binary" for binary responses or "polytomous" for polytomous responses.}
\item{factor_labels}{List containing the original factor labels when polytomous responses
are provided as factors. NULL if no factor data is present.}
\item{categories}{Numeric vector containing the number of response categories for each item.
For binary data, all elements are 2.}

\description{
A function to reshape long data into a dataset suitable for Exametrika.
