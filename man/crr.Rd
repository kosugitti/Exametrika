\title{Correct Response Rate}
\usage{
crr(U, na = NULL, Z = NULL, w = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{U is a data matrix of the type matrix or data.frame.}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of weighted correct response rates for each item.
Values range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate easier items
(more students answered correctly).
}
\description{
The correct response rate (CRR) is one of the most basic and important
statistics for item analysis. This is an index of item difficulty and
a measure of how many students out of those who tried an item correctly
responded to it. This function is applicable only to binary response data.

The CRR for each item is calculated as:
\deqn{p_j = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{ij}u_{ij}}{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{ij}}}
where \eqn{z_{ij}} is the missing indicator and \eqn{u_{ij}} is the response.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simple binary data
U <- matrix(c(1,0,1,1,0,1), ncol=2)
crr(U)

# With missing values
U[1,1] <- NA
crr(U, na = NA)
}
}
